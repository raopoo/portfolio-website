                <p>I am a Melbourne based web developer who loves all things tech, food and travel.</p><br>
                <p>I was born in India and lived in multiple cities in India and UK. We moved to Australia 2 years ago. </p><br>
                <p>I come with 5+ years of experience in the customer service industry. I made a decision to take a career break to care for my family. The break also gave me the opportunity to travel and live in the UK and Europe for a couple of years. </p><br>
                <!-- <p>I have had the opportunity to volunteer at salvos store for a few months that I will cherish all my life. I would love to try new  volunteering opportunities in future too.</p><br> -->
                <p>I am a full stack web development bootcamp graduate where I learnt technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, SQL, Node JS and Express. I would love to start my journey as a developer at a firm where I can contribute in making customer centric products. </p>
